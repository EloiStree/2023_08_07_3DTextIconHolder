# 2023_08_07_3DTextIconHolder
This tool allows to generate 3D object and icon that hold text to be interpreted/emitted.


The idea here is that I need some code that allows me to store some "code" as text on 3D object in aim to move them in 3D and create sequence of code that can be change by moving them. The aim is to create macro on the go in XR.

This tool can be use in other way, but that the initial goal.
